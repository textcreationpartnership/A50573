            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Papiſts have of late given us ſuch freſh Occaſions by their horrid and damnable Conſpiracies againſt the Perſon of our King, our Government, and our Religion; to renounce and deteſt the Communion of that Church, which does not onely allow men, but teaches them to be Murderers and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And we have yet ſo great reaſon to apprehend the diſmal Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their ſecret and helliſh Machinations, that I am confident no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which tends to heighten and improve the juſt Prejudices of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> against that impious and abſurd Religion, will be thought at this time unneceſſary by any good Proteſtant. I ſhall not therefore make any Apology for the Collecting and Printing this Epitome of the three grand Maſſacres in <hi>Piedmont, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is intended chiefly for the Inſtruction of ignorant and unlearned People; for we fear not that Scholars and men of Sence ſhould be made Papiſts, except ſuch whoſe Morals are ſo wretchedly debauch'd, that they are ready at all times to ſacrifice their Conſciences to their Civil Intereſts; and I hope there are not ſo many of thoſe deſperate Proſtitutes as the Papiſts are apt to imagine, and as the Manners of the Age we live in, may (I confeſs) give us just cauſe to apprehend: No, 'tis the ordinary Rank of men, who have not had the advantage of Learning and a generous Education, to defend themſelves againſt the ſtudied Fallacies and ſpecious Pretences of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Agents, who commonly become the prey of thoſe <hi>Wolves in Sheeps clothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To provide therefore for their Security, that they may not fall into the ſnares that are laid for them, ought to be our chiefeſt care, ſince as 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:96410:3"/>more charity to ſtrengthen the hands of the weak, than to add force to the ſtrong; ſo in this caſe 'tis more prudent too, in order to the ſupport of the common cauſe of Proteſtant Religion, the ignorant being by far the greater number. Nor is this to be done a better way, than by furniſhing them with ſuch plain Arguments as they are able to apprehend and manage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the confuſion of the common Enemy. And theſe can be no other than ſuch as are drawn from matters of fact, they being eaſieſt to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and hardeſt to be anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon it was, that this ſhort Narrative of the bloudy Butcheries and inhuman Murders heretofore committed upon the perſons of Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, by <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, in cold bloud, and by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their Church, was prepared for the Preſs at the deſire of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman, (whoſe Zeal for the Intereſt of his Country and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion deſerves a publick mention, would his Modeſty permit it) in order to the being by him beſtowed among his Country Neighbours, who ſome of them perhaps have never heard of, and others may have forgot the ſtory of theſe holy Popiſh Cruelties, theſe Religious Villanies; the deſign being to let ſuch ſort of people ſee what a horrid thing Popery is, when her Varniſh is taken off; what a deform'd and frightful Face this gawdy painted Whore,<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 17.2, 9, 6.</note> 
               <hi>With whom the Kings of the earth have committed fornication, this mother of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Jeſus;</hi> I ſay, what a deform'd and frightful Face ſhe has when her Paint is laid by, and ſhe appears by true Lights in her proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; what monſtrous and abominable Actions Papiſts are capable of, when the Intereſt of that Idol of theirs (their Church) requires them. By which as well as by their late Plots here in <hi>England,</hi> 'tis not hard for men of the meaneſt Capacities to perceive, that their Religion cannot be the Religion of Chriſt, while it juſtifies them in the groſſeſt Immoralities, and engages them in the most unchriſtian practices. That thoſe deteſtable Doctrines of <hi>Depoſing and Killing Kings, and extirpating Hereticks,</hi> which have been ſo often objected to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by Proteſtant Divines, are not <hi>Speculative Notions and Propoſitions Problematical,</hi> as ſome of the Popiſh Writers, and particularly the Author of that Lying Libel, called<note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. 77.</note> 
               <hi>The Compendium,</hi> would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but ſuch ſettled Maxims of their barbarous Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Policy, as too often have been, and again will be put in practice, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that proud uncharitable Church has a ſafe occaſion to do it; though at
<pb facs="tcp:96410:3"/>other times they muſt be diſown'd with the uſual Popiſh Impudence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſuch Proteſtants as have ſo little wit to take what they ſay on truſt, or ſo little reading not to be able to diſprove them.</p>
            <p>I hope no man will underſtand me here, as if from the bare Actions of Papiſts, and nothing elſe, I argued to the Principles of Popery, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the one from the other; this were bad Charity, and worſe Logick, and one of their own conſtant Topicks in their Writings againſt Protestants: 'twere (to ſay the worſt that can be of it) to fall directly into the ridiculous way of reaſoning uſed by the <hi>Compendioniſt,</hi> when he pretends to anſwer the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Book, that admirable and learned Diſcourſe; a Diſcourſe of ſo great uſe at this time, and which does with ſuch undeniable Evidence convince the Religion of Papiſts to be guilty of all their traitorous and bloudy Deſigns againſt Kings and Protestants, that I cannot but take this occaſion to correct that troubleſom Impertinent, who has made ſuch a ſenſleſs Buzze, and rais'd ſuch a duſt about it, with deſign to puzzle and darken thoſe Truths, which the Biſhop has there made ſo plain and clear, eſpecially ſince the Biſhop himſelf has not thought him (as indeed he is not) worthy of his notice, and no body elſe that I know of, has yet expos'd that part of his impudent Pamphlet, which concerns this truly Venerable and Excellent Perſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, what a fooliſh Flouriſh does he make againſt the Biſhop, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to throw that wicked Principle of <hi>Depoſing Kings</hi> upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, with this groſs Fallacy of Arguing from mens Practices to the Principles of their Religion? <hi>Is not his Lordſhips mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſays<note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. 77.</note> he, <hi>in truth this, that Proteſtant Principles (when really believ'd) are deſtructive to all Kings, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Catholick ones? ſince we ſee that the lawful Monarchs of England, Scotland, Swedeland, Denmark, the United Provinces, Tranſylvania, Geneva, &amp;c. have been actually depos'd by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects.</hi> This <hi>(&amp;c.)</hi> here I gueſs to be a Lie of the loweſt price in their Book of Rates for Sin; 'tis ſo pitiful and inconſiderable a Trick. He puts it down as if there were a vaſt and tireſom number of Countries behind, which in kindneſs to his Reader he forbears to mention, where Princes have been depos'd by Proteſtants; when he know in his Conſcience be could ſcarce have named one more, if it had been to gain the Popedom; if he could, I doubt not but we ſhould have had it at full length. Well; but in thoſe Countries he has nam'd, <hi>Princes (it ſeems) have been actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by their Proteſtant Subjects.</hi> And what then? Does it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:96410:4"/>follow, that the Proteſtant Religion teaches the Doctrine of Depoſing Kings? Or may it not indeed teach the quite contrary for all that? Did this wretched Trifler never hear of men who have acted contrary to the Principles of their Religion? Where has he liv'd? In a Convent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, among the moſt Seraphick Saints of his Church;<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi>'s Phanaticiſm of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pag. 276.</note> I me an thoſe mad Phanaticks of the Sect of Abbot <hi>Joachim,</hi> who according to their new <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Aeternum,</hi> have been in a ſtate of perfection ever ſince the Year <hi>1260.</hi> I wonder when his hand was in, and while he was induſtriouſly ſtuffing out his thin Diſcourſe with big and ſounding words, he did not bring all the Proteſtant Criminals, and other ill men, who have been any way famous ſince the Reformation, upon the ſtage, and then charge the Proteſtant Religion with Felony, and Murder, and Treaſon, and Adultery, and Perjury, and what not? The Conſequence had been altogether as good, and the Triumph as juſt. We do not reaſon at this looſe and abſurd rate, when we accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of Principles which juſtifie the <hi>Depoſing and Murdering of Princes,</hi> and the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring of millions of innocent people, whom with a ridiculous affectation ſhe terms Hereticks. But we firſt prove her (as my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> has unanſwerably done) to have ſuch Principles; and this not onely from the Books of her moſt eminent Writers, (upon thoſe Teſtimony we always lay the leaſt weight) allow'd and commended by her ſelf, but from that Law which is the Rule of Juſtice in her Eccleſiaſtical Courts, from the Authentick Bulls and Decretals of her Popes. And laſtly, (which is the greateſt Evidence that is poſſible in the caſe) from the Canons of her Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils. Then we urge matters of fact, conformable to them, to ſhew that they are not things of bare ſpeculation and deſpute among Caſuiſts and Schoolmen, but ſuch neceſſary Rules for the ſupport of her Hierarchy, as have been frequently put in practice, to the great ſcandal of the Chriſtian Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>To come to particulars: We ſhould not lay to her Charge the Murders of <hi>Henry III.</hi> and <hi>Henry IV.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe they were committed by Members of her Communion, if, beſides the publick Applauſe of the one by the then Pope, in a ſet Speech to the College of Cardinals, we had not firſt convinc'd her of holding ſuch Principles as juſtifie both. We ſhould not accuſe her of the ſeveral Conſpiracies of Papiſts here in <hi>England</hi> againſt the Lives of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles I.</hi> and His preſent Majeſty, if, beſides the proving upon her the before mention'd
<pb facs="tcp:96410:4"/>Principles, ſhe had not actually and formally (as for as it lay in her power) Excommunicated and Depos'd them all, and Abſolv'd their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance. We ſhould not accuſe her of the Maſſacres of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> becauſe her Sons were there the <hi>Brethren in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the Sons of Violence,</hi> that acted unprovok'd thoſe diſmal Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if, as an additional proof of her holding the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Principles, ſhe had not<note n="(a)" place="margin">Thuanus Hiſt. l. <hi>53.</hi> p. <hi>837.</hi>

Does he think it the ſame thing to hold indefinitely, <hi>That Princes may be depos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of Religion;</hi> and to hold, <hi>That the Church has a Right to depoſe them upon that account?</hi> to hold that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by an Authority Civil, and to hold that they may be depos'd by an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Eccleſiastical? Let him now ſpeak his Conſcience without a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Does he in good earneſt think theſe two Propoſitions equivalent, or at leaſt equivalent as to the point in controverſie between him and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and that they equally diſgrace the profeſs'd Religion of him who affirms them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He cannot fare be ſo void of the ordinary reaſon of a Man, though he has ſwallow'd down never ſo many Roman Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as not to perceive as palpable difference between them. 'Tis not but that the former of theſe Poſition is a very bad Principle, dangerous to Princes, and deſtructive to the Peace and Settlement of a Nation, though not ſo much as the later, becauſe it wants the Enforcements of Conſcience
<pb facs="tcp:96410:5"/>and Religion to fix it in the Mind, and thruſt it out upon occaſion into Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that violence, which uſually accompanies a pretended Zeal for the Honour of God. But how bad ſoever it may be, ſtill 'tis a Civil, not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Principle; and though it may be Sedition in the higheſt degree, it can never be Hereſie; a mans Life and Eſtate (who maintains it) is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for it, not his Religion. To make this a little clearer I ſay, 'Tis one thing to hold, that Princes may be depos'd by the State, though upon the account of Religion, (<hi>i.e,</hi> for being of a Religion different from the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd) grounding this Opinion upon the Laws and Cuſtoms of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Civil Conſtitutions, or upon the ends of Government in general; and quite another thing to hold, that they may be depos'd by the Church, grounding this Opinion upon the Laws of Religion, and a Power ſuppos'd to be delegated to her by Chriſt. This laſt is the Principle we charge, and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> has prov'd upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which makes her Religion it ſelf dangerous to Princes. On the other ſide, though <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin,</hi> or any other Proteſtant Divines ſhould hold the firſt, though it be a falſe and a bad, yet (as I ſaid before) 'tis a Civil Principle, and their holding it could no more reflect on the Proteſtant Religion, than an Error they might be guilty of in Hiſtory or Mathematicks. The Proteſtant Religion therefore remains clear from any ſuſpicion of allowing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Depoſing Princes,</hi> (the point I undertook to make good) though it ſhould be granted the <hi>Compendioniſt,</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. have had ill Principles in relation to Civil Governments. If he could prove indeed that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any other Proteſtant Divines, have held <hi>The Lawfulneſs of Depoſing Princes,</hi> as a Principle of their Religion, and plac'd the power of doing it in the Church, he would ſay ſomething that were to the purpoſe, and parallel to what we accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of, but in the Method he has taken, he does but beat the Air, and fight with Shadows.</p>
            <p>I ſhall explain this Diſtinction a little further by ſome famous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in order to meet with the other Cavils of this idle Wrangler, and make the Inconſequence of his Arguings (if it be poſſible) yet more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. He may remember then, that here in <hi>England Edward II.</hi> and <hi>Richard II.</hi> were <hi>actually</hi> depos'd in times of Popery, and by Papiſts; yet did our Writers never charge the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (though ſhe held then the ſame Doctrines, and had the ſame pride to trample on Princes that now ſhe has) with thoſe two diſloyal and unjuſt Uſurpations upon the Sovereignty of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> And for what imaginable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:96410:6"/>but this onely, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they were both Acts of the Civil Power, and carried on by mon who grounded what they did upon Principles (though groſly falſe and miſtaken) drawn from the Conſtitution of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Government, and the Rights of the two Houſes of Parliament; and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to her Cuſtom upon ſuch occaſions, was onely a bare Spectator, neither her Authority nor her Principles being made uſe of to further or juſtifie thoſe Proceedings. I would now ask this Collector of Impertinencies, this tedious <hi>Compendioniſt,</hi> whether he thinks this a good reaſon to clear the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from being concern'd in the depoſing theſe two unfortunate Princes. If he ſays 'tis, as no doubt he will, with what face can he pretend to charge the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as he would be underſtood to do <hi>pag 76. lin. 38.</hi>) with the Endeavours that were us'd to keep Queen <hi>Mary</hi> from the Crown, the Death of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>If on the other-ſide</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Biſhop means that there have been Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctors of the opinion, that Princes might be Depos'd upon the account of Religion, what Advantage, I would fain know, can that be to his Lordſhip, or his Treatiſe, ſince not only all the prime Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Reformation, &amp;c?</hi> Is it to be imagin'd now, that a man ſhould get ſo far out of his way, unleſs he purpoſely deſign'd to ramble, or write things ſo groſly impertinent to the matter he was treating of, unleſs he ſtudied to confound it, and render it as little intelligible as was poſſible? Never did any man take more true pains to underſtand a Diſcourſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in it ſelf, than he has done to miſunderſtand the Biſhop's, which was plain and eaſie, or a leaſt to make his Reader do ſo; for he cannot be ſo dull himſelf in this Point as he would ſeem. 'Tis not poſſible that he, or any man who has read the Biſhop's Book, ſhould think it was the Biſhop's meaning only to charge the Popiſh Doctors with holding indefinitely, <hi>that Princes might be Depos'd upon the account of Religion,</hi> when 'tis ſo palpably evident in a hundred places of his Book, that he only brings their Opinions as a collateral proof of his Charge of their Church and Religion, and that with a quite different Tenet, as I have already ſhew'd. And
<pb facs="tcp:96410:7"/>as 'tis the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and not the Doctors, only, or chiefly, which the Biſhop charges with holding, <hi>that Princes may be Depos'd by her Authority, not with holding indefinitely that they may be Depos'd upon the account of Religion:</hi> So 'tis the preſent Popiſh Canon-Law, the Bulls, the Decretals of Popes, and the Canons of General Councils, which are the Teſtimonies he relies upon for the making good of his Charge, and not the private Opinions of Popiſh Doctors, though being cited out of Books licens'd and approv'd by that Church, they are of conſiderable weight in the Argument. Now what ſays the <hi>Compendioniſt</hi> to theſe ſtrong and most convincing Proofs? <hi>Why in fine</hi> (<hi>as Mr.</hi> Bayes <hi>ſays upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other occaſion</hi>) <hi>he wont tell us.</hi> He has not one word, not one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of Anſwer to them, but paſſes them over with as deep a ſilence, and as good a grace, as if they were, like most of his own, not at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This diſcreet and neceſſary Reſolution being taken, he bends all his little Wit, and with a great deal of chearfulneſs, goes about to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date what the Biſhop urges from the Writings of the Popiſh Doctors, which yet the poor impotent Scribler is by no means able to do; as I have made appear in my Anſwer to his Charge of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi> The Attempt however was juſt as wiſe, and as likely to ſatisfie reaſonable men, as if a General, who had a great and well diſciplin'd Army to fight with, ſhould neglect the Main Body, and with his whole Strength ſet upon the Forlorn Hope.</p>
            <p>For his Objections of the Proteſtant Rebellion in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the late Riſing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Murther of the Archbiſhop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and that <hi>Home-Blow</hi> of his, the <hi>Gazet Advertiſement</hi> of <hi>The Tryals of Twenty nine Proteſtant Regicides,</hi> they are of the ſame nature, and grounded on the ſame pitiful Falacy with thoſe I have already anſwer'd; and when he can ſhew us any Principle of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> that juſtifies <hi>Rebellion</hi> or <hi>Murder,</hi> eſpecially that of Princes, or does but in the remoteſt degree encourage men to commit theſe deteſtable Crimes, I ſhall again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them: In the mean time, let him not waſt his Paper, and tire his Reader with the Repetition of ſuch fulſom Sophistry.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it may not be amiſs to give a more particular Anſwer to his <hi>Home-Blow,</hi> becauſe he has ſuch an opinion of its force, and does ſo triumph with the conceit of his Victory, I ſhall endeavour therefore to take him down in the height of his Rapture, and ſhew his ignorant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. The <hi>Reader</hi> will remember the Point he ſhould prove, is, <hi>That Proteſtant Principles are deſtructive to Kings;</hi> for thoſe are the very
<pb facs="tcp:96410:7"/>words of the Introduction to his terrible Argument of <hi>Inſtances of Fact.</hi> Now did the <hi>Twenty nine Proteſtant Regicides</hi> ever pretend to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their abominable Villany by any Principle of their Religion? Nay, did they not pretend the quite contrary, and ground it wholly upon a Civil Authority? Did they not argue the lawfulneſs and justice of it from a Power they fancied in the People, to call the King to an Account for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? Though in this they were as abſurd Logicians as the <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioniſt</hi> has all along ſhew'd himſelf, and reaſon'd not only againſt the very firſt Principle of Civil Policy; but point blank contrary to the moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <hi>Maxims</hi> of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which ſays, <hi>That the King can do no wrong;</hi> and therefore makes his Miniſters queſtionable for the Miſcarriages in Government, becauſe he himſelf is in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, inviolable and ſacred: but this concerns not the preſent Buſineſs. Theſe men I ſay, (as bad as they were) had not the Impudence to Intereſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> or any <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> whatever, in the guilt of their impious Treaſon, by pretending to derive any Warrant or Encouragement for it from them; or if they had, it would have ſignified nothing to the <hi>Compendioniſt</hi>'s purpoſe, ſince there is no <hi>King-depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> or <hi>King-killing</hi> Principle to be found in any Proteſtant <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Articles of Communion,</hi> (which are the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Evidences to convince a <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> of any Principle or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that is laid to her charge) and ſo it would have amounted to no more than their particular miſtaking or perverting the Principles of their Religion, as groſly and as wilfully as they did the Laws of their Country. But this is not the caſe; for they did not ſo much as pretend any Warrant from the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> for what they did: How then can He charge <hi>Proteſtant Principles</hi> with the <hi>Perſonal Crimes</hi> of theſe men? Or what does this <hi>Home-Blow,</hi> and all his other Inſtances prove, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this only, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſeveral <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been <hi>Rogues, very great Rogues, Murderers, Rebels, Traytors, &amp;c.</hi> Does He not know that they are all mortal men too, and ſubject to many other Vices, which he might very clearly have prov'd upon them (if he had pleas'd) by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Examples? There's not a Sin the <hi>Pope</hi> pardons, of what Price ſoever, but 'tis too ſadly true, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been guilty of it at ſome time or other, if that will do him any ſervice. But now, in the name of a little common ſenſe, Who, or what does this <hi>Raver</hi> oppoſe in this ſtrenuous Argument? Did ever any of our Writers aſſert that all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in the world were good Men, and pious Christians? Or is there
<pb facs="tcp:96410:8"/>any ſort of people among us beſides Quakers, <hi>i. e.</hi> mad men, who hold a ſtate of Abſolute Perfection in this Life? He has put himſelf into an extraordinary Heat, and made ſtrange violent Aſſaults, and yet no Enemy appears near him. What ayles the man? he has ſure been combating ſome Giant in imagination, like <hi>Don Quixote</hi> when he hack'd down the Walls of his Chamber. Well, who ever he be, though it were <hi>Malambruno</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I'll warrant him he's kill'd outright, this <hi>La Mancha</hi> has ſo laid about him with <hi>Home-Blows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another great quarrel he has to the Biſhop is, that he does not anſwer four Books (nam'd in the <hi>Compendium</hi>'s margin) writ (it ſeems) <hi>by the Catholicks of England ſince the King's Reſtoration,</hi> about <hi>the Depoſing Power of the Church;</hi>

But without Raillery, does he believe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> oblig'd to take particular notice of every idle Pamphlet of theirs, that keeps a Pudder about <hi>the depoſing Power of the Church,</hi> (with deſign to make the buſineſs intricate and dark) and to think them as conſiderable, as his Party always do their own Books? No doubt he takes it monſtrous ill too, that the Biſhop has not thought him worth his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, and perhaps concludes himſelf unanſwerable. But I hope I ſhall hinder him from falling into that miſtake, and make him ſenſible what an <hi>Impar Congreſſus Achilli,</hi> what a poor contemptible thing he is, when he appears in the Liſts againſt ſo great a Scholar as the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> For the Pamphlets he mentions, they are more than anſwer'd in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Book, though it does not particularly name them; and when he, or any other <hi>Factor for Popery,</hi> gives a tolerable Anſwer to thoſe clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies I told him of before, (<hi>and which he never ſo much as cites to this purpoſe</hi>) by which the Biſhop does ſo plainly prove the Doctrine of <hi>Depoſing Kings</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I here engage my word to him, theſe Pamphlets ſhall be made ridiculous by name, and their Authors ſhew'd to the people in the Fools Coats they deſerve.</p>

But what does he hope by Poſitiveneſs to face us down, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> are the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Or that the Univerſities of <hi>France</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> are her Repreſentatives? Is it poſſible he ſhould believe we have not Logick enough to diſtinguiſh between the Parts and Branches of a Church, and the Church her ſelf in her publick Authority and Repreſentations? Does he indeed imagine, that he can at this time of day make the Judgments of particular Univerſities and Civil Aſſemblies paſs upon us for publick Acts and Declarations of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> He muſt needs pardon us; we have been too often told it upon other occaſions; to be ignorant now, that nothing but the Decrees of a Pope or a General Council are the publick Acts and Declarations of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and he has not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew either of theſe, for the Condemnation of thoſe Principles which the Biſhop has prov'd upon his Religion by both.

               </gap>ounds?</p>
            <p>I thought to have paſs'd by this Quibble upon the Biſhop's Title, 'tis ſo very ſenceleſs and thin a conceit; but becauſe I find he is apt to think every
<pb facs="tcp:96410:9"/>thing unanſwerable that is not particularly taken notice of, I ſhall do him the favour to make the Reader obſerve this ridiculous Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm: <hi>Who could think</hi> (ſays<note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. 76.</note> he) <hi>that His Lordſhip's Heat againſt us ſhould force him even to a Title that has confuted his whole Book,</hi> viz. <hi>That Popiſh Principles and Poſitions (when really believ'd) are deſtructive and dangerous to all Kings, eſpecially Proteſtants; for he cannot term them Principles of Faith, becauſe they were never thus believ'd, &amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe by <hi>Principles of Faith</hi> here, he means what is commonly understood by <hi>Articles of Faith, i. e.</hi> Points neceſſary to Salvation; for the words are equivocal, and may bear ſeveral ſences: but becauſe this is moſt favourable to his Objection, I ſhall understand them ſo. Now why cannot the Biſhop term theſe Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Principles of Faith?</hi> He has prov'd them to have been decreed both by Popes and Councils, and if that be not enough to make any Point a <hi>Principle of Faith</hi> in their Church, I know not where or how we ſhall find any <hi>Principles of Faith</hi> among them. He ſays indeed here (and in other places would inſinuate the ſame) <hi>That they were never thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by any Catholick, nor never thus approv'd of by the Church.</hi> But that's onely his word againſt the Biſhop's Proof, and ſignifies nothing but to convince the world of the ſhameleſs Impudence of Popiſh Writers, who can even in Print, and in the face of a learned and inquiring People, affirm things contrary to direct Proofs, without ever ſo much as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to anſwer thoſe Proofs. I ſee no reaſon therefore why the Biſhop might not have term'd them <hi>Principles of Faith,</hi> if he had pleas'd, but that it was not at all material to the deſign of his Diſcourſe ſo to do; 'twas enough for his purpoſe to prove them <hi>Principles of their Religion,</hi> (which he has moſt clearly done) no matter whether they hold them neceſſary to Salvation, or not; their very holding them as <hi>Principles of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> does make that ſufficiently dangerous to Princes, which was what the Biſhop undertook to ſhow. But let us ſuppoſe now, that the Biſhop can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not term theſe Poſitions <hi>Principles of Faith,</hi> I'le engage it ſhall do his Title no more hurt, than 'tis plain it would his Book; indeed neither of them any at all. <hi>This Title</hi> (ſays he) <hi>That Popiſh Principles and Poſitions (when really believ'd) are deſtructive, &amp;c. has confuted his whole Book.</hi> Why? Becauſe he cannot term them (pray mark the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) <hi>Principles of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> Can any unprejudic'd man now, whoſe Brains lie in their right place, perceive any ſort of Conſequence in this Argument? for my own part I can find none. But if there be any little
<pb facs="tcp:96410:10"/>ſence at the bottom of this awkard Blunder, it muſt be this, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, that the real Belief of any <hi>Principle of Religion</hi> makes it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a <hi>Principle of Faith,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> in his ſence of thoſe Terms, a point neceſſary to Salvation) though it was not ſo before: which is certainly the moſt extravagant Whimſey that ever got hold of any mans Imagination, but our confus'd <hi>Compendianiſts;</hi> and if this be not his meaning, he talks <hi>Wild Iriſh,</hi> and is utterly unintelligible. I think I need not go about to confute ſuch ſelf-evident Foolery as this; the very Offer were an affront to the meaneſt Reader's Underſtanding; there's hardly a School-boy, but knows that Chriſtian Religion teaches many uſeful and true Doctrines, which are not neceſſary to Salvation, that yet are really believ'd by all thoſe that are really of the Chriſtian Religion. The Biſhop's Title therefore is very proper, and very conſiſtent with the deſign of his Book, and this man's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to it moſt aſſurd and frivolous. 'Tis indeed not onely proper, but charitable and modeſt; it implies the Biſhop does not believe, that all who live in the external Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are either ſo diſloyal to their Prince, or ſo unmerciful to their Friends and Neighbours, as thoſe Doctrines he charges upon her, really and heartily aſſented to, muſt needs make them. He hopes poſſibly, that Humane Nature it ſelf in ſome may check at their harſhneſs, and a particular ſweetneſs of temper of others, very much allay the Malignancy of their Poiſon, and hinder them from having their full effect upon the Underſtanding, at leaſt ſuch an effect as is juſtly to be dreaded from them, when they ſeize upon the minds of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Recluſes, or ſink deep into the affections of her ignorant hot-headed Devoto's, thoſe Chriſtian<note n="(a)" place="margin">A Sect of Religious Murderers among the <hi>Turk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <head>AN ACCOUNT Of the Chief Paſſages of the MASSACRE IN The Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in the Year 1655.</head>
               <p>WHEN the following Sheets had paſſed the Preſs, and the Preface was ready for it, a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had ſet me on work to collect and publiſh them, ſignified his deſire that I ſhould add one Sheet concerning this Maſſacre; but becauſe it may be though moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to conclude with Domeſtick Occurrences, and becauſe the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my Friends deſire came too late for placing this Sheet next after the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre, where in reference to Time it ſhould have been plac'd, I was oblig'd to put it in the Front.</p>
               <p>Before I come to treat of this Maſſacre in particular, it will be neceſſary to give you an Account of the Antiquity of the Reformed Churches in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with the cauſes of this and other Perſecutions, which have been raiſed againſt them by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the firſt Apoſtacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>As for their Antiquity, I affirm that the Chriſtian Religion, which was planted in <hi>Italy</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> has ever ſince been retained in the Primitive Purity of its Fundamental Doctrines and Divine
<pb facs="tcp:96410:12"/>Worſhip, in the Churches of <hi>Piedmont</hi> to this day. And for the Proof of this Aſſertion I muſt acquaint you, that though many of their moſt ancient Records, and other Authentick Manuſcripts, were deſtroyed by Popiſh Perſeeutors in the years 1559 and 1560; yet a great number no leſs Authentick (divers of which are now to be ſeen in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi>) were moſt wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and give as full and clear a Teſtimony to this Truth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have the concurrent Teſtimonies of the moſt eminent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Authors, who were the bittereſt Adverſaries of theſe Churches; and yet (which is almoſt miraculous) they have, by a ſtrange over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence, unwittingly confeſs'd in many places of their Writings this Antiquity, for the concealing of which, and to make the World disbelieve it, thoſe very Books were purpoſely written and deſign'd. To demonſtrate theſe Particulars by ſome Inſtances, I muſt inform you, that it is a Truth generally received by all thoſe who profeſs to be vers'd in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, that before the Year 800 the differences between the <hi>Roman</hi> and Reformed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, were not publickly eſtabliſh'd by any General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils or Decrees, in any part of <hi>Italy.</hi> As for the firſt 500 years after Chriſt, there cannot ſo much as one clear Sentence be produc'd out of any one Father or Council for the Papiſts againſt the Proteſtants. In the next Century, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 600, <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third of that name, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (with the conſent and approbation, if not inſtigation of the Uſurper, Traitor, and Murderer <hi>Phocas,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) took upon him the Title of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop,</hi> in which he was confirm'd by a Council held at <hi>Rome</hi> the Year following. After this, Corruptions and Hereſies crept apace into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were ſtill oppoſed by ſome famous Writers of theſe Churches, both in this and the ſeventh Century, about the end of which, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 794, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great having called a Council at <hi>Franckfurt,</hi> did with the Weſtern Churches joyntly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have drawn Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> out of that gulph of Superſtition and Idolatry, into which it was fallen, by perſuading them to embrace the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. But this deſign proving then ineffectual, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Son and Succeſſor to <hi>Charles,</hi> undertook, and proſecuted the ſame in the eighth Century; and in order thereunto amongſt other things he preferr'd to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Turin,</hi> of which
<pb facs="tcp:96410:12"/>the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> are part, one <hi>Claudius,</hi> a chief Counſellour to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and one of the moſt renowned men of his Age as well for Piety as Learning, in the Year 815. But this good man finding that he could not reſiſt that mighty torrent of Superſtitious and Idolatrous Blaſphemies, which were taught and practis'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> endeavour'd to keep his own Dioceſes from being infected with them; and to this end he told his People, <q>That they ought not to run to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Pardon of their Sins, nor have recourſe to the Saints or their Reliques; that the Church is not founded upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> much leſs upon the Pope, but upon the Doctrine of the Apoſtles; that they ought not to worſhip Images nor ſo much as have them in their Churches, &amp;c.</q> Theſe words we find in a Book written by a grand Adverſary of his. Alſo the ſame Author, and others of the ſame ſtamp confeſs, <q>That <hi>Claudius</hi> and his Diſciples and Succeſſors, were People of good Lives and Principles, and that nothing could be objected againſt them; for (ſays one) whereas all other Sects render themſelves horrible by reaſon of their Blaſphemies againſt God, this hath a great appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Piety, in as much as they live juſtly before men, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve aright concerning God in all things, and hold all the Articles of the Creed; there is onely one thing againſt them <hi>viz.</hi> that they deny the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the holy Mother Church, and will not obey her Traditions.</q> Another ſaith, <q>That theſe men did own the Chriſtian Church in all other points, and that he reckon'd and eſteem'd them true Members of it.</q> I ſhall quote one Popiſh Writer more, who was very famous in his time; he in a Book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the year 1632, with <hi>approbation and privilege</hi> ſaith, <q>That the aforeſaid Doctrine (which he calls Hereſie) continu'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ninth and tenth Centuries.</q> And afterward in another Book printed at <hi>Turin</hi> in the year 1649, dedicated to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſpeaking of the Doctrine which the Churches of the Valleys then held, he ſaith, <q>It is the ſame which <hi>Claudius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Turin</hi> (and conſequently of the Valleys being within that Dioceſe) maintained in the eighth Century.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you have ſeen the conſtant and uninterupted Succeſſion of the Doctrine of theſe Churches from the times of the Apoſtles to that of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and ſo through the ninth and tenth Centuries, till the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> came into theſe Valleys, which was in the eleventh
<pb facs="tcp:96410:13"/>Century, where they have profeſs'd and taught the ſame ever ſince. I need not take the pains to prove the continued Succeſſion of this Doctrine in thoſe Churches from the eleventh Century till now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Popiſh Writers do unanimouſly confeſs it; but ſeeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them have had the impudence to tell the World, that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> who eſcaped the Maſſacre in <hi>France,</hi> in the year 1165, and came from thence into the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> were the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that Religion, which the Inhabitants there own and profeſs at this preſent, I cannot but anſwer ſuch Writers by telling them, that it is not at all probable that the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who knew that the Seat of their grand Adverſary was in <hi>Italy,</hi> could have been ſo void of all ſence and common prudence, as to have undertaken ſo long and tedious a Journey over the <hi>Alps,</hi> had they not been well aſſured beforehand, that tho Natives of thoſe Valleys had profeſſed the ſame Religion with them, and would receive and embrace them as Brethren. I ſhall conclude this ſubject with a paſſage mention'd in the Preface of a <hi>French</hi> Bible, which theſe Inhabitants cauſed to be printed at their own charge in the year 1535, and dedicate it to God himſelf, where ſpeaking as it were to him they ſay, <q>That they had always fully enjoy'd that Heavenly Truth contained in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, ever ſince they were enriched with the ſame by the Apoſtles themſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I now come to give you the Cauſes of the Maſſacre in the Year 1655; and though many might be aſſign'd I ſhall mention two onely, <hi>viz.</hi> the one general, and the other particular; the general Cauſe was the implacable Hatred and Malice of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Clergy, againſt the Reformed Churches in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and in truth this hath been the Cauſe of all the other Maſſacres and Perſecutions which have happen'd not onely in thoſe Valleys, but in all other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ever ſince the Apoſtacy of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church has taken place, and her tyrannical and uſurped Power prevail'd in the World. The particular Cauſe of this and other Maſſacres and Perſecutions that have happen'd in theſe Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, is the yearly allowance of Penſions, Prebends. Biſhopricks Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, and Priories by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the moſt eminent perſons of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Court, upon condition of doing their utmoſt to deſtroy the Proteſtants and their Religion.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:13"/>
               <p>The principal means made uſe of by theſe Courtiers, for effecting their deſigne, were the ſame which had always prov'd ſucceſsful formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> they incenſed the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> againſt his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects by many calumnies, and falſe ſuggeſtions, too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to be here inſerted, in ſo much that he publiſh'd an Order dated the 25th of <hi>January</hi> 1655. by which he commanded all his Proteſtant Subjects of what age, ſex, or condition ſoever, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting certain Valleys therein mention'd, to depart to other Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys therein alſo nam'd, in three days, upon pain of death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they ſhould turn Papiſts within twenty days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though theſe poor Chriſtians endeavour'd by their humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and Supplications to have oblig'd him to revoke this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and tyrannical Order, yet he utterly refuſed to do it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was not able to anſwer one of thoſe many Arguments urged in their Petitions to induce him to grant their deſires. I ſhall name three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> They urge the ſeveral Conceſſions made to them, and their Anceſtours by the Duke and his Predeceſſours for the free exerciſe of the reformed Religion in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their civil Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They urge that their Religion was planted in thoſe Valleys by the Apoſtles, and hath ever ſince their days been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there, and that their Anceſtours inhabited thoſe Valleys a very long time before the firſt Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> poſſeſſed any part of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and therefore that this Duke could not without great and palpable injuſtice, deprive them of their ancient Civil, or Religious Rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They urge that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe Valleys to which they were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to go, did ſcarcely afford a Subſiſtance to the Inhabitants that were there already.</p>
               <p>To this they added, that if his Royal Highneſs would grant them a hearing, they would be content to ſubmit to this ſevere Order, provided their Adverſaries could prove any one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by which they might deſerve ſo great a puniſhment, or the leaſt unkindneſs from his Royal Highneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all this proving ineffectual, at laſt they deſired only ſo much time as might be ſufficient for the diſpoſal of their Goods, before their
<pb facs="tcp:96410:14"/>Removal; but this being alſo denied them, thoſe diſtreſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians refuſed divers advantageous Offers made them by the Duke, in caſe they would turn Papiſts, chuſing rather to ſuffer all the miſeries of humane life, and of a ſhameful and painful death, and therefore quitting their Houſes and Goods, they retir'd according to the Order with their Wives and Children, great and ſmall, old and young, whole and ſick, with many lame, blind, and Ideots, dragging thoſe that were infirm by reaſon of Age or Sickneſs, through the Rain, Snow, Ice, and a thouſand difficulties, by which a great many of them periſhed. And this they did to teſtifie their Obedience to their Prince, thereby cutting off all manner of pretence from their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, of branding them with Rebellion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now conclude with a few Inſtances of Popiſh Cruelties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon the Bodies of thoſe Proteſtants that remained in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> during the Maſſacre, which begun in the Moneth of <hi>April</hi> 1655.</p>
               <p>A Woman who had ſeen ſeveral Proteſtants cruelly put to death by the Popiſh Souldiers, was her ſelf raviſh'd, and then had her Breaſts and part of her Privities cut off by ſome of them, who carried the ſame to the next Town, where they cauſed it to be fried, and ſet before ſome of their Comrades, telling them they were Tripes.</p>
               <p>A poor man that was a Servant being taken priſoner by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſome of them gave him divers Stabs with a Dagger in the Soles of his Feet, and in his Ears; afterward they cut off his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, and then applied a burning Candle to the Wound, frying it with the ſlame thereof, that ſo the Bloud might be ſtopp'd, and his Torments prolong'd. This being done to their minds, they tore off his Nails with hot Pincers, to try if they could by any means force him to renounce his Religion. But when nothing would do, they tied one of his Legs to the tail of a Mule, and ſo dragg'd him till he was almoſt dead, then binding his Head about with a Cord, they ſtrained and twiſted the ſame with a Staff ſo hard, that his Eyes and Brains drop'd out of his Head; and at laſt having ſatiated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all the Cruelties they could deviſe, they threw his Body into a River.</p>
               <p>They tied a man about 80 years old neck and heels together, and hurl'd him down a vaſt Precipice; but as he was falling he lighted in a cragged Branch of a True, where he hung ſeveral days till he languiſhed and died.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:14"/>
               <p>They cut in ſmall pieces a man of 90 years old, and did the like to a Woman, and then ſtrewed the Giblets and Mammocks of the torn Carkaſes along the High Way, and hung ſome of them on Hedges.</p>
               <p>They cut off the Noſe, then the Fingers, and laſt of all the Hands, of an ancient decrepid Woman, and then left her to languiſh and die in this deplorable condition.</p>
               <p>Another Woman was found in a Cave, whoſe Fleſh was all ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from off the Bones, ſo that ſhe appeared as a mere Skeleton. <hi>A moſt dreadful Spectacle!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They took a Maid, and having driven a long Stake through her Body, ſome of them carried her about upon their Shoulders as an Enſign, and at laſt they ſtuck one end of the Stake into the ground, and ſo left her in the High Way to be viewed by Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>They put two men into a Dungeon, and having ſtript off the Skin of their Arms and Legs by long Slices like Leather Points, they afterward ſuffer'd them to ſtarve there in that condition.</p>
               <p>They took a beautiful young Girl of ten years old, and becauſe her Age and Stature had render'd her incapable of the ordinary courſe of Nature, ſome of them forced her Body in ſo brutiſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane a manner, that ſhe was found afterward half dead, and wallowing in her own bloud.</p>
               <p>Another young Girl about the ſame Age, they took as ſhe fled from them upon the Snow, and having thruſt a Pike or Halberd through her Body, they roaſted her alive.</p>
               <p>They hung one man upon a Gate by the Hands which they had tied to his Privities; and becauſe they could not make him renounce his Religion, they took him down, and having exerciſed many other Cruelties upon him, they at laſt diſpatched him.</p>
               <p>They alſo hung two other men by their Privities, (having firſt tied their Hands behind them) till at laſt the weight of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had almoſt torn out their Bowels, and ſo they died in horrible pain.</p>
               <p>They cut off the Noſe, Ears, and other parts of a man of 80 years old, and left him in that condition in the Snow, where having lain a long time he at laſt died.</p>
               <p>Having taken ſeveral Men and Women, they cramm'd Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into their mouths, and down their throats, and then putting fire to it they tore their Heads in pieces.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:15"/>
               <p>They pull'd out a mans Eyes, then cut off his Privities, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thruſt his Yard into his mouth, they expos'd him in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to publick view ſeveral days; and not content with this, they afterward fley'd him alive, and then cutting his Skin into four parts, they hung the ſame in the Windows of the four chief Houſes of a Town.</p>
               <p>Having taken eleven men, they heated an Oven red hot, and then forc'd theſe poor Creatures to throw one another into the Oven ſucceſſively; and when it came to the laſt man, they themſelves threw him in.</p>
               <p>Having torn off the Nails of a certain Schoolmaſter, and prick d his Hands full of holes with a Dagger, they ſtript him, and putting a Cord about his middle, dragg'd him naked through a Town, and almoſt every ſtep he made a Souldier on the one ſide cut off a piece of his Fleſh with a Hanger, and another on the other ſide gave him a blow with a Staff, crying, <hi>Well, what ſayst thou now, wilt thou yet go to Maſs?</hi> To which the poor man with an incredible conſtancy, as long as he was able to ſpeak, anſwer'd, <hi>Much rather Death than the Maſs; diſpatch me quickly for the love of God.</hi> Whereupon one of them gave him a great blow on the head, and then cutting it off they threw his Body into a River.</p>
               <p>I want both time and paper to mention any more particular Acts committed by Popiſh Miſcreants in theſe Valleys, onely I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that having barbarouſly butcher'd divers Proteſtants, they did (Canibal-like) cauſe the Brains, and ſeveral parts of the Bodies of theſe poor Martyrs to be fried, or otherwiſe dreſs'd, and did then eat the ſame.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid it is evident, that though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Maſſacres might exceed this in reſpect of the Numbers that were kill'd outright; yet in reſpect of the variety of ſavage Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is as evident that this Maſſacre is without parallel.</p>
               <p>If you deſire a large and full account of the Antiquity of theſe Churches, and of their many Sufferings under the Papacy, I refer you to that excellent Hiſtory entituled, <hi>The Hiſtory of the Evangelical Churches in the Valleys of Piedmont,</hi> publiſhed by Sir <hi>Samuel Morland</hi> in the Year 1658.</p>

               <head>A RELATION Of the Barbarous and Bloody MASSACRE OF ABOUT <hi>An Hundred Thouſand</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>begun at</hi> Paris, <hi>and carried on over all</hi> France, <hi>in the year</hi> 1572.</head>
               <p>I Am confined to a Sheet of Paper, and therefore ſhall be obliged to relate only the moſt remarkable Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that occur in the beſt <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Helliſh Butchery, which take as follows:</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, being a ſworn Enemy to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, was exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to find, that notwithſtanding all the endeavours he had uſed to deſtroy his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects by force of Arms, yet their number, inſtead of being diminiſhed, did ſtill increaſe; and having likewiſe found all his politick arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices vain and unſucceſsful, he at laſt reſolved to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his wicked deſign againſt them by Treachery, Perjury, and breach of Faith, Which he effected thus;</p>
               <p>After 12 years Civil Wars, the King concluded a Peace with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by which he granted them the free exerciſe of their Religion, and to make them the more ſecure, he propoſed a Marriage between his Siſter and the
<pb facs="tcp:96410:16"/>King of <hi>Navar,</hi> foreſeeing, that if this Propoſal ſhould take effect, great numbers of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would reſort to <hi>Paris,</hi> to attend the Nobility and Gentry of their Party, eſpecially to attend the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> her Son, the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> with others of the higheſt Rank, all which (the ſaid Marriage beeing ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concluded) were invited to the Wedding. The Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> came to Court in confidence of the King's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Intentions towards the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> according to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated Oaths and Proteſtations to that purpoſe, and was received with all the outward expreſſions of kindneſs and affection that could be, as the Admiral had been, who came to Court a little before her; but in a few dayes ſhe fell ſick and dyed, having, as is ſaid, been Poiſoned by a pair of perfum'd Gloves.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Cardinal <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> Brother to the Admiral, (who had newly before leſt his Red Hat, and turned <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>) was Poiſoned at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Though theſe Poiſonings were then only ſuſpected, yet ſome of the Admiral's Friends gave him divers reaſons why they doubted the King had ſome evil deſign againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but the good Man would not believe if, becauſe of the King's reiterated Oaths, that he had a Kindneſs for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general, and above all, for the Admiral in particular.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1572. the King of <hi>Navar</hi> was Married, and the 24th was the fatal Day of that Horrid <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> which cannot be parallel'd in Hiſtory, unleſs by that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which afterwards happened, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with a great crew of his Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds went to the Admirals Lodgings early in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to diſpatch him firſt; when they had broken open his Gates, he roſe out of his Bed, and as ſoon as he had put on his Night-Gown, he commended his Soul to God, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:96410:16"/>his Friends and Servants that were about him to ſhift for themſelves, for that they could do him no good by ſtaying any longer with him. Which words he had no ſooner uttered, but ſome of the Murtherers were come up to his Chamber; to the foremoſt of whom he ſaid, <hi>Young man you ought to reverence my gray Hairs, but you cannot ſhorten my life much.</hi> They all ſtood a while amazed at ſuch undaunted Courage, and ſo compoſed a behaviour, which one of them ſaid, was the moſt extraordinary thing that ever he ſaw in his whole life. But they ſoon diſpatch'd him; and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being below, called to them to throw him out at the Window, which was done, and his Head being out off, was preſented to the Queen Mother, and then Embalmed and ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi> Then all manner of <hi>Popiſh</hi> barbarity was exerciſed on the dead Corps, <hi>viz.</hi> his Fingers and Hands were cut off, his Body dragg'd about the Streets three days, then thrown into the River of <hi>Seine</hi> and taken out again, and hanged in Chains by the Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the King not content with the Murther of this noble Admiral's body, for (to cover the infamy of ſo foul and damnable a fact) he reſolves to murther his reputation alſo; and therefore he pretends that the Admiral had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt his Life and Crown: Alſo the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> did (by the King's Order) adjudge the Admiral guilty of the ſaid Conſpiracy (though they had no Proofs at all of it) and thereupon ordained his Body to be hanged, if it could be found; or if not, that he ſhould be hanged in Effigie, his Houſe to be razed, and a Pillar ſet up with an Inſcription to defame his Memory; his Blood was alſo attainted, and his Children declared ignoble, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Privileges in <hi>France.</hi> This Sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with an Order for celebrating St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s day in all time coming with Proceſſions and public Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,
<pb facs="tcp:96410:17"/>for the diſcovery and puniſhment of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.</p>
               <p>Two other Perſons of Quality were alſo condemned for this pretended Conſpiracy, and for refuſing to accuſe the Admiral of being guilty thereof. They were drawn in Hurdles to the place of Execution, and having by the way endured with admirable patience the reproaches and dirt caſt on them by the rabble, they were Hanged, together with the Noble Admiral in Effigie, having aſſerted both his Innocency and their own to their laſt breath. After their death, their Bodies were barbarouſly mangled by the accurſed multitude; and the King (who delighted in ſuch bloody ſpectacles) did not only behold it himſelf, with the Queen Mother, and the Court, but forced the King of <hi>Navar</hi> to be preſent likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The King, who had drawn the chief of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> as aforeſaid, upon the occaſion of the Wedding, (tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that he did not ſo properly give his Siſter to the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> as to their whole Party, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them and all the other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of what rank or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoever that could be found in that City to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, he ſends immediately ſecret Orders to his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and other principal Officers throughout his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to cauſe the like Maſſacres to be committed upon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in all Places, without exception; of which I ſhall forbear to give you a particular account here, becauſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to mention the ſeveral ſorts of barbarous Murthers, invented by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and by them exerciſed upon the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for there was no kind of Butchery practiſed in <hi>France,</hi> but was repeated, with additions in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Anno</hi> 1642. to which Story I refer you, and ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to acquaint you, that together with the King's ſecret Orders for the Maſſacres, were ſent his Letters to be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in all Places, ſignifying, that his Majeſty intended
<pb facs="tcp:96410:17"/>ſtrictly and inviolably to obſerve the Treaty of Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oluded with the <hi>Protestants,</hi> whereby the free exerciſe of their Religion was granted, for by this means he deſign'd to ſurpriſe them, by rendring them ſecure, and fearleſs of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which accordingly fell out, for they depending on the King's Faith, Honour, and Juſtice, had not the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of any Treachery intended againſt them, otherwiſe a great many of them might have eſcaped that general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, in which they were involved.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French Popiſh</hi> Hiſtorians differ much about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that were Maſſacred, but the moſt Famous of them tell us that there were no leſs than 100000 Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, which is likewiſe aſſerted by the Biſhop of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> (who was Tutor to the preſent <hi>French</hi> King) in his Book lately publiſh'd of the Civil Wars of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will give you but two Inſtances more of this King's Perfidiouſneſs toward the <hi>Protestants;</hi> one of which is, That although he had Sworn to the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> that they ſhould not only enjoy their Lives and Liberties, but their Religion too; yet as ſoon as the Maſſacre in <hi>Paris</hi> was over, he ſent for them; and told them that they muſt turn <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> or they ſhould be Maſſacred as their fellow Hereticks had been. Whereupon, after ſome reſiſtance, they went to Maſs, and wrote Letters full of ſubmiſſion and obedience to the Pope, though they were no ſooner out of that ſnare, but they renounced their new Religion, ſaying, that what had been obtained of them, was extorted by force.</p>
               <p>The other inſtance is, that while he was making the deepeſt Proteſtations, ſeconded with many dreadful Oaths, that he would in all points exactly obſerve the Peace he had made with the <hi>Protestants,</hi> he did at the very ſame time pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately aſſure the Pope's Legate, that notwithſtanding the Peace and Marriage, all he was doing was for the Intereſt
<pb facs="tcp:96410:18"/>of the <hi>Catholic</hi> Religion. And one day, taking him by the hand, he deſir'd him to aſſure the Pope, that his deſign in this Marriage was, that he might be revenged on thoſe that were Enemies to God, and Rebels againſt himſelf, and that he would either cut them in pieces, or loſe his Crown. All which he would do in complyance with the Advices he had received from the Pope, who had (as he ſaid) continually ſet him on to deſtroy them; and that he ſaw no way of doing it ſo ſecurely, as by getting them once to truſt him, having tried all other Methods in vain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though this wicked Prince was ſcarce inferiour to any one recorded in Hiſtory, for Treachery, Diſſimulation, Perjury, breach of Faith, Cruelty, and Blood thirſtineſs, and though he was ſucceſsful in his wickedneſs; yet he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his laſt deſign of fathering a Plot againſt him upon the Admiral and the <hi>Protestants;</hi> for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers of that time in <hi>France,</hi> do confeſs, that there was not the leaſt colour to oblidge a Man to believe the ſaid Plot, and that it was invented to take away the Scandal of ſo black and helliſh a Maſſacre, as has been already ſaid.</p>
               <p>A certain Hiſtorian, writing of this Maſſacre, ends with theſe words; <hi>Thus were the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>deſtroyed in</hi> Paris, <hi>with a Treachery and Cruelty that the uncivilized Nations had never ſhewed to one another, nor had the</hi> Heathens <hi>been ever guilty of any thing like it towards the</hi> Chriſtians. The Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had formerly given in the Maſſacre of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> was the likeſt thing in Hiſtory to it for Barbarity; but never had Treachery and Cruelty met together in ſuch a manner before this execrable day. And one of the <hi>French</hi> Writers adds, that beſides 100000 <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Slain, there were as many ſent a Begging.</p>
               <p>But there is no Crime or Villany ſo execrable, which his Holineſs cannot Conſecrate, and therefore his Legate grants a Jubilee to all that had been employed in that
<pb facs="tcp:96410:18"/>Butchery, and they were commanded to go every where to Church, and bleſs God for the ſucceſs of that action. And ſo great was the Blaſphemy that the Murtherers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to addreſs to that merciful Being, who abhors cruel and blood-thirſty men, and that with hands defiled with Blood; and alſo boaſted of it as a Sacrifice to God, which had been a ſitter Oblation to him, <hi>who was a I yer and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer from the beginning,</hi> than to the <hi>God of Truth, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King alſo Gloried ſo much in this Maſſacre, that he cauſed Medals to be made, to repreſent the Memory of it; but this was only a falſe ſhew of joy and triumph, for he was inwardly tormented with the horrour of a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which the effuſion of ſo much Blood did juſtly raiſe in him; ſo that being often troubled with Viſions, he was frequently heard ſay; <hi>Ah, my poor Subjects! What had you done? But I was forc'd to it.</hi> The ſtrange manner of his death, ſeems a ſignal Judgment from Heaven for that Bloody day; for after a long Sickneſs, Blood not only came out through all the paſſages of his Head and Body, but through the very Pores of his Skin, ſo that he was ſomtimes found all bath'd in Blood; and he that had made his Kingdom ſwim with Blood at laſt died wallowing in his own. An Inſtance ſcarcely to be parallel'd.</p>
               <p>You have ſeen the Cruel, Perfidious, Tyrannical, and Barbarous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, againſt his innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects, being the effects of his execrable and bloody Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and thoſe Principles founded on the abominable, and helliſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Maxims, taught by his Holy Mother, the Apoſtate <hi>Romiſh</hi> Synagogue, as will appear by the following inſtance, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> As ſoon as the tydings of this Maſſacre was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> (being <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. 1572.) a Conſiſtory of the Cardinals was preſently called, and the Legate's Letter, that contained a Relation of the Maſſacre being tend, they ſtrait went in Proceſſion to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church; where they offered up their ſolemn Thanks to God for this great Bleſſing to the <hi>See</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:96410:19"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. Two days after, another Proceſſion was made by the Pope and Cardinals, to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> where they had High Maſs, and then the Pope granted a Jubilee to all <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and one of the reaſons was, <hi>That they ſhould thank God for the ſlaughter of the Enemies of the Church, lately executed in</hi> France. Again, two days after that, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> had another great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of all the Clergy, the Ambaſſadors, Cardinals, and the Pope himſelf, who came to St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Chappel, where the Cardinal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf celebrated Maſs. Then in the name of the King of <hi>France</hi> he thanked the Pope and the Cardinals for the help they had afforded him, both by their Counſels, and Prayers, of which (he ſaid) he had found moſt happy effects. He alſo delivered the King's Letter to the Pope, in which he wrote, <hi>That more Heretics had been deſtroy'd in that one day, than in all the twelve years of the War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did the Pope think there was yet blood enough ſhed, but that which all the World condemned as exceſſive cruelty, he apprehended was too gentle. Therefore he ſent Cardinal <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> his Legate, in all haſt to <hi>France,</hi> to thank the King for ſo great a Service, done the Church, and to deſire him to go on, and extirpate Hereſie, root and branch, that it might never grow again. In order to which, he was to procure the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to be received in <hi>France.</hi> And as this Legate paſſed through <hi>France,</hi> in his Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> he gave a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Abſolution to all that had been actors in the Maſſacre.</p>
               <p>The beſt Picture Drawers, and Workers of Tapiſtry, were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet off this Action with all the Glory poſſible, and a Suit of theſe Hangings continue to this day in the Pope's Chappel; ſo that they ſeem to like the thing ſo well, that they preſerve the Memory of it ſtill, even in the place of their worſhip. And indeed ſuch a repreſentation does very well agree with their Devotion, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Doctrin led on their Votaries to the thing ſo expreſſed. By this we may eaſily gather, what is to be expected from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> if ever we ſhould lie at the mercy of Men, whoſe Religion will not only bear them out, but alſo ſet them on to commit the moſt treacherous and bloody Maſſacres.</p>
               <p>I conclude with this Proteſtation, that whatſoever hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by me in this Relation, as matter of Fact, hath been faithfully collected out of the moſt famous <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers at that time in <hi>France,</hi> and from none elſe. which I am able to prove, if requir'd ſo to do.</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Moſt Remarkable Paſſages OF THE Iriſh Maſſacre, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642.</head>
               <p>THAT the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts do hate <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants more becauſe they are Proteſtants, than becauſe they are <hi>Engliſh,</hi> will clearly appear if we conſider, that this Maſſacre was acted by the Inſtigation of the Jeſuits, Prieſts, and Friers; and alſo that not ſo much as one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſt was kill'd with the Proteſtants, but on the contrary, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts were joint Actors in the ſaid Maſſacre, which was ſo bloudy and barbarous, that I think it cannot be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd in Hiſtory, and I hope never will be.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts did unanimouſly reſolve to deſtroy all the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet when they began to execute their damnable deſign, they onely turned Proteſtants out of doors, and ſtript them, but afterward finding that they every where prevailed, they at laſt murdered Men, Women, and Children, without ſparing any, as you will ſee by what follows.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts gave the Sacrament unto divers of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> upon condition they ſhould ſpare neither Men, Women, nor Children of
<pb facs="tcp:96410:20"/>the Proteſtants. One <hi>Hulligan</hi> a Prieſt read an Excommunication againſt all thoſe, that from thenceforth ſhould relieve or harbour any <hi>Engliſh, Scotiſh,</hi> or <hi>Welch</hi> Proteſtants, or give them Alms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many were famiſhed. The Friars exhorted them with tears not to ſpare any of the ſaid Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>The day before this Maſſacre began <hi>Anno</hi> 1642, the Prieſts gave the people a Diſmiſs at Maſs, with liberty to go out and take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Lands of the Proteſtants, as alſo to ſtrip and rob, and deſpoil them of all their Goods and Cattel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> when the Maſſacre began, perſuaded many of their Proteſtant Neighbours to bring their Goods to them, and they would ſecure them; and hereby they got abundance peaceably into their hands, whereof they cheated them, refuſing to reſtore them; yet ſo confident were the Proteſtants at ſuſt of them, that they gave them Inventories of all they had, and digged up their beſt things that were hidden in the Ground, and depoſited them in their cuſtody. They alſo got much into their hands by fair promiſes, deep Oaths and Engagements, that if they would deliver them their Goods, they would ſuffer them with their Wives and Children quietly to depart the Countrey; and when they had got what they could, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards murder'd them.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſeized upon their Goods and Cattel, ranſack'd their houſes, got their perſons, ſtript Man, Woman, and Child naked, they turn'd them out of doors, ſtrictly prohibiting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> under great penalties not to give them any Relief. By means hereof many miſerably periſh'd through Cold, Nakedneſs, and Hunger.</p>
               <p>In the Town of <hi>Coleraine,</hi> of theſe poor people that fled thither for ſuccour, many thouſands died in two days, ſo that the Living could not bury the Dead, but laid their Carcaſſes in ranks in waſte and wide holes, piling them up as if they had been Herrings.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Magdalen Redman</hi> depoſeth, That ſhe and divers other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, amongſt whom were two and twenty Widows, were firſt robbed, and then ſtript naked, and when they had covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Straw, the bloudy Papiſts threw in burning Straw amongſt them, on purpoſe to burn them; then they drove them out into the Woods in Froſt and Snow, where many of them died with extreme Cold, and thoſe that ſurvived lived miſerably by reaſon of their many Wants.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:20"/>
               <p>Yet though theſe bloudy Villains exerciſed ſuch inhumane Cruel ties towards the poor Proteſtants, they would commonly boaſt, <hi>That theſe were but the beginning of their ſorrows;</hi> and indeed they made it good, for having diſarmed the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> robbed them of their Goods, ſtript them of their Clothes, and having their perſons in their power, they furiouſly broke out into all manner of abominable Cruelties, horrid Maſſacres, and execrable Murders.</p>
               <p>For there were Multitudes murder'd in cold bloud, ſome as they were at Plough, others in their Houſes, others in the High Ways; all without any provocation were ſuddenly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>In the Caſtle of <hi>Liſgool</hi> were about one hundred and fifty Men, Women, and Children conſumed with fire. At the Caſtle of <hi>Tullab,</hi> which was delivered to <hi>Mac Gutre</hi> upon Compoſition, and ſaithful promiſes of Fair Quarter, as ſoon as he and his entered, they began to ſtrip the people, and moſt cruelly put them to the Sword, murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all without mercy.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Liſſenskeath</hi> they hanged and killed above one hundred of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Proteſtants. In the Counties of <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> where the Proteſtants were more numerous, their Murderers were more multiplied, and with greater cruelty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mac Guire</hi> coming to the Caſtle of <hi>Liſſenskeath,</hi> deſired to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> who admitted him in; he firſt burnt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the County, then demanded one thouſand pounds which was in his cuſtody of Sir <hi>William Balfore</hi>'s, which as ſoon as he had, he cauſed Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> to hear Maſs, and to ſwear that he would never alter from it, and then hanged him up with his Wife and Children; hanging and murdering above one hundred perſons beſides in that place.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Portendown Bridge</hi> there were one thouſand Men, Women, and Children carried in ſeveral companies, and all unmercifully drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the River; yea, in that Countrey there were four thouſand perſons drowned in ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>In one place an hundred and ſorty <hi>Engliſh</hi> were taken and driven like Cattel for many miles together. Other companies they carried out to a place fit for execution, and then murder'd them. One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen Men, Women, and Children, they ſent with Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Oneal</hi>'s Paſs till they came to <hi>Portendown Bridge,</hi> and there drowned them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:21"/>
               <p>At another time one hundred and forty Proteſtants being thrown in at the ſame place, as any of them ſwam to the Shore, the bloudy Villains with the Butt-ends of their Muſquets knock'd out their Brains.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Armagh O Cane</hi> got together all the Proteſtants thereabouts, pretending to conduct them to <hi>Coleraine;</hi> but before they were gone a days journey they were all murder'd, and ſo were many others, though they had Protections from Sir <hi>Philem Oneal.</hi> The Aged people in <hi>Armagh</hi> were carried to <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and there mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>Preſently after the Town of <hi>Armagh</hi> was burnt, and five hundred perſons murdered and drowned. In <hi>Killoman</hi> were forty eight Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies murder'd. In one Houſe twenty two Proteſtants were burnt. In <hi>Kilmore</hi> all the Inhabitants were ſtript and maſſacred, being two hundred Families. The whole Countrey was a common Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; many thouſands periſhed by the Sword, Famine, Fire, Water, and all other cruel Deaths that Rage and Malice could invent.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Caſel</hi> they put all the Proteſtants into a loathſom Dungeon, kept them twelve Weeks in great miſery; ſome they barbarouſly mangled, and left them languiſhing; ſome they hanged up twice or thrice, others they buried alive.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Queens County</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> his Wife, and five Children, and a Maid, were all hang'd together. At <hi>Clowns</hi> ſeventeen Men were buried alive; ſome were wounded and hanged upon Tenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Caſtle Cumber</hi> two Boys wounded, and hung upon Butchers Tenters. Some hanged up and taken down to confeſs Money, and then murder'd. Some had their Bellies ript up, and ſo left with their Guts about their Heels.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Kilkenny</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman was beaten into a Ditch, where ſhe died with her Daughter about ſix years old, whoſe Belly they ript up, and let out her Guts. One they forced to Maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Man they ſtript and hewed to pieces, ript up his Wifes Belly ſo that her Child dropt out. Many other Women they hung up wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:96410:21"/>
               <p>In the County of <hi>Armagh</hi> they robbed, ſtripped, and murdered abundance of Proteſtants, whereof ſome they burned, ſome they ſlew with the Sword, ſome they hanged, ſome they ſtarved to death; and meeting Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Frankland</hi> with ſix of their Children, and themſelves both with child, they murder'd them all, ript open the Gentlewomens Bellies, took out their Children and threw them into a Ditch. A young <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Womans Child they took by the Heels, and daſh'd out its Brains againſt a Tree; the like they did to many other Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anne Hill</hi> going with a young Child on her back, and ſour more by her ſide, they pulled the Child off her back, trod on it till it died; ſtripped her and the other four Children naked, whereby they died of cold.</p>
               <p>Some others they met with, hanged them up upon a Windmill, and before they were half dead cut them in pieces with their <hi>Skeins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many other Proteſtants, eſpecially Women and Children, they pricked and ſtabbed with Skeins, Forks, and Swords; ſlaſhing, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and mangling them in their Heads, Faces, Breaſts, Arms, and other parts; yet killed them not, but left them wallowing in their own bloud, to languiſh, ſtarve, and pine to death.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Liſgeole</hi> being ſet on fire by theſe mercileſs Papiſts, a Woman lept out at a Window to ſave her ſelf from burning, whom they preſently murder'd. Many fled to Vantls and Cellars, where they were all murder'd. One <hi>Joan Addis</hi> they ſtabbed, and then put her Child of a quarter old to her Breaſt, and bid it <hi>Suck Engliſh Bastard,</hi> and ſo left it to periſh.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Mary Barlow</hi> had her Husband hang'd, her ſelf with ſix Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſtript naked in Proſt and Snow, after which ſheltering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Cave, they had nothing to eat for three Wecks but two old Calves Skins, which they beat with ſtones, and ſo cat them Hair and all.</p>
               <p>In the cold weather many thouſands of Proteſtants of all Ranks, Ages, and Sexes, being turned out naked periſhed of Cold and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thouſands of others were drowned, caſt into Ditches, Bogs, and Turf-pits. Multitudes miſerably burnt in Houſes. Some that lay ſick of Feavers they hanged up; ſome Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they drove into Boggy Pits, and knock'd them on the head.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:22"/>
               <p>Some aged Men and Women theſe barbarous Papiſts enforced their own Children to drown; yea, ſome Children were compelled unnaturally to execute their own Parents, Wives forced to hang their own Husbands, and Mothers to caſt their own Children into the Waters, after which themſelves were murder'd. In <hi>Sligo</hi> they forced a young man to kill his Father, and then hanged him up. In another place they forced a Woman to kill her Husband, then cauſed her Son to kill her, and then hanged the Son. Yea, ſuch was their malice againſt the Proteſtants, that they taught their Children to kill Proteſtant Children.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Trulls that followed the Camp cried out, <hi>Kill them all, ſpare neither Man, Woman, nor Child.</hi> They took the Child of <hi>Thomas Stratton,</hi> being about twelve years old, and boiled him in a Caldron. One Good Wife <hi>Ian</hi> and her Daughter they carried into a Wood, firſt hanged the Mother, and then the Daughter in the Hair of her Mothers head.</p>
               <p>In ſome places they plucked out the Eyes, and cut off the Hands of the Proteſtants, and turned them into the Fields, where they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. The Women in ſome places ſtoned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women and Children to death. One man they ſhot through his Thighs, digged a hole in the ground, ſet him in upon his feet, fill'd up the hole, left out onely his Head, where he languiſhed to death. They held an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans feet in the fire till he was burned to death.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Munſter</hi> they hanged up many Miniſters in a moſt barbarous manner. One Miniſter they ſtript naked, and drove him through the Town, pricking him with Darts and Rapiers till he ſell down dead.</p>
               <p>Theſe barbarous Villains vowed, <hi>That if any Parents digged Graves to bury their Children in, they ſhould be buried therein themſelves.</hi> They ſtripped one <hi>William Loverden</hi> naked, then killed him before his Wife and Children. Divers Miniſters Bones that had been buried ſome years before they digged up, becauſe they were (as they ſay) <hi>Patrons of Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poor Children that went out into the Fields to eat Weeds and Graſs they killed without all pity.</p>
               <p>A poor Woman whoſe Husband was taken by them, went to them with two Children at her Feet and one at her Breaſt, hoping to beg her Husband; but they ſlew her and her ſucking Child, brake
<pb facs="tcp:96410:22"/>the neck of another, and the third hardly eſcaped. And all this Wickedneſs they exerciſed upon the Proteſtants without any provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation given them. Alas, who can comprehend the Fears, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Anguiſh, Bitterneſs, and Perplexity that ſeiz'd upon the poor Proteſtants, finding themſelves ſo ſuddenly ſurprized without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and wrapt up in all kind of outward miſeries which could poſſibly by Man be inflicted upon human Creatures! What Sighs and Groans, Trembling and Aſtoniſhment; what Shrieks, Cries, and bitter Lamentations of Wives, Children, Servants, and Friends howling and weeping, finding themſelves without all hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from their preſent miſeries! How inexorable were their barbarous Tormentors, that compaſſed them in on every ſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bowels of compaſſion, or the leaſt commiſeration or pity! Yea, they boaſted of their Cruelties.</p>
               <p>Theſe mercileſs <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts having ſet a Caſtle on fire, wherein were many Proteſtants, they rejoycingly ſaid, <hi>O how ſweetly do they fry!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Kilkenny</hi> when they had committed many cruel Murders, they brought ſeven Proteſtants Heads, one the Head of a Reverend Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; all which they ſet upon the Market Croſs on a Market day, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, ſlaſhing, and mangling them: they put a Gag in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's mouth, ſlit up his Cheeks to his Ears, and laid a Leaf of a Bible upon it, and hid him <hi>Preach for his Mouth was wide enough.</hi>
               </p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>more</hi> they put many Proteſtants, Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, into a Thatch'd Houſe, and there burnt them. They threw Mrs. <hi>Maxwell</hi> into the River when in Labour, the Child being half born when the Mother was drowned.</p>
               <p>In one place they burnt two Proteſtant Bibles, and then ſaid, <hi>It was Hell fire they burnt.</hi> Other Bibles they took, cut in pieces, and then burnt them, ſaying, <hi>They would do the like to all Puritan Bibles.</hi> They took the Bible of a Miniſter called Mr. <hi>Edward Slack,</hi> and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it they laid it in a Puddle of Water, and then ſtamp'd upon it, ſaying, <hi>A plague on it, this Bible hath bred all the quarrel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Glaſtow</hi> a Prieſt with ſome others drew about forty <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Proteſtants to be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then told them, <hi>They were in a good faith, and for fear they ſhould fall from it and turn Hereticks,</hi> he with his Companions preſently cut all their Throats.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:23"/>
               <p>In the County of <hi>Tipperary</hi> near the Silver Works ſome of theſe barbarous Papiſts met with eleven <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> ten Women, and ſome Children; whom they firſt ſtript, and then with Stones, Pole-axes, Skeins, Swords, &amp;c. they moſt barbarouſly maſſacred them all.</p>
               <p>In the County of <hi>Mayo</hi> about ſixty Proteſtants, whereof fifteen were Miniſters, were upon Covenant to be ſafely conveyed to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> by one <hi>Edmund Burk</hi> and his Souldiers; but by the way this <hi>Burk</hi> and his Company began to maſſacre theſe poor Proteſtants; ſome they ſhot to death, ſome they ſtabb'd with their Skeins, ſome they thruſt through with their Pikes, ſome they drowned; the Women they ſtript naked, who lying upon their Husbands to ſave them, were run through with Pikes; ſo that very few of them eſcaped with Life.</p>
               <p>In the Town of <hi>Sligo</hi> forty Proteſtants were ſtript and lock'd up in a Cellar, and about midnight a Butcher provided for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was ſent in amongſt them, who with his Ax butcher'd them all.</p>

               <p>The Son of Mr. <hi>Mentgomery</hi> a Miniſter, aged about fifteen years, met with his Schoolmaſter, who drew his Skein at him; whereupon the Boy ſaid, <hi>Good Maſter, whip me as much as you will, but do not kill me.</hi> Yet this mercileſs Tiger barbarouſly murder'd him without all pity.</p>

               <p>They brake the Back bone of a Youth, and left him in the Fields; ſome days after he was found, having eaten the Graſs round about him; neither then would they kill him out right, but removed him to better paſture.</p>
               <p>In the County of <hi>Antrim</hi> they murdered nine hundred fifty four Proteſtants one morning, and afterwards about twelve hundred more in that County. Near <hi>Liſnegarry</hi> they forced twenty four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants into a Houſe, and burnt them all.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Philem Oneal</hi> boaſted, <hi>That he had ſlain above ſix hundred at</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah; <hi>and that he had left neither Man, Woman, nor Child alive in the Barony of</hi> Munterlong.

               <p>Above twelve thouſand were ſlain in the High Ways, as they fled towards <hi>Doun.</hi> Many died of Famine, many died for want of Clothes, being ſtript naked in a cold ſeaſon. Some thouſands were drowned.</p>

                  <hi>Anne Kinnard</hi> teſtified, That fifteen Proteſtants being impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Feet in the Stocks, a Popiſh Boy (being not above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old) ſlew them all in one night with his Skein.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, who was newly delivered of two Children, ſome of theſe Villains violently compelled her, in her great pain and ſickneſs, to riſe out of her Bed; and took one of the Infants that was living, and daſhed his Brains againſt the Stones, and then threw him into the River of <hi>Barrow.</hi> The like they did by many other Infants; many others they hanged up without all pity.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Mont Garret</hi> cauſed divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers that he had taken about <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to be hanged, hardly ſuffering them to pray before their death.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Fitz Patrick</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, enticed a rich Merchant that was a Proteſtant, to bring all his Goods to his Houſe, promiſing ſafely to keep them, and to redeliver them to him; but when he had got them into his poſſeſſion, he took the Merchant and his Wife and hanged them both. The like he did by divers others.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> Heads they cut off, and carried them to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and on the Market-day ſet them on the Croſs, where many (eſpecially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And not far off they took divers Men, Women, and Children, and hanged them up; one of the Women being great with child, they ripped up her Belly as ſhe hanged, ſo that the child fell out in the Cawl alive. Some after they were hanged, they drew up and down till their Bowels were torn out.</p>
               <p>How many thouſands of Proteſtants were thus inhumanely but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher'd by ſundry kinds of death we cannot aſcertain.</p>
               <p>As for the Proteſtant Miniſters whom they ſurprized, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was firſt to ſtrip them, and after bind them to a Tree or Poſt where they pleaſed, then to raviſh their Wives and Daughters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Faces, (in ſight of all their mercileſs Rabble) with the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Villains they could pick out; after that they hanged up their Husbands and Parents before their Faces, and then cut them down before they were half dead, after diſmember d them, and ſtopped their Mouths therewith, then quarter'd them.</p>
               <p>They baſely abuſed one Mr. <hi>Trafford</hi> a Miniſter in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who being aſſaulted by theſe bloudy Wolves of <hi>Rome</hi>'s breed, that know not God, nor any Bowels of mercy; this diſtreſſed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter deſired but ſo much time as to call upon God before he went out of the world, but theſe mercileſs Wretches would admit no time, but inſtantly falling upon him hack'd and hew'd him to pieces.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Patrick Dunſtan</hi>'s Wife they raviſh'd before him, ſlew his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſpurned his Children till they died, ſo bound him with Match to a Board that his Eyes burſt out, cut off his Ears and Noſe, tore off both his Cheeks, after cut off his Arms and Legs, cut out his Tongue, and after run a red hot Iron into him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, theſe infernal Miſcreants, to expreſs their malice againſt the Proteſtants, did not onely kill all the Cattel belonging to the Proteſtants that they could come at, (if they could not drive them away) but did commonly take great delight in tormenting the Beaſts, for they would not diſpatch thoſe poor Animals preſently, but would either cut off a piece or two of their Buttocks, or cut off one of their Legs, and ſo leave them roaring and bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>French</hi> King is ſlain by the Hands of a Friar.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96410:26"/>
               <p>For unto this it may truly be compar'd, though the Prophet ſpake of another thing, namely, of the Incarnation of our Lord, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all other Wonders and Miracles. As alſo the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> referreth the ſame words unto the Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 41. When the Prophet ſays <hi>Awork,</hi> he means not by it ſome common or ordinary thing, but a rare and notable matter, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembred, as that of the Creation of the World, <hi>The heavens are the work of thy hands;</hi> and again, <hi>He reſted the ſeventh day from all the works which he had made.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>I have wrought,</hi> with theſe words the Scripture is wont to expreſs things not to come to paſs caſually, by fortune or accident, but things fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out by the determined Counſel, Will, Providence, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. As our Saviour ſays, <hi>The works that I do ſhall ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> do alſo, and greater works than theſe, Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 12. and many more in Holy Writ to the like purpoſe. Now that he ſays, that it is done in times paſt, herein he follows the uſe and manner of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who for the certainty of the Event are wont to predict things to come, as if they were paſt already; for as the Philoſophers ſay, <hi>Things paſt are of neceſſity, things preſent of being, and things to come onely of poſſibility:</hi> ſo do they ſpeak. For which certainty the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> long before prophecying of the Death of Chriſt, hath thus ſpoken, <hi>He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, and like a lamb dumb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſhearer, ſo opened he not his mouth, &amp;c.</hi> as it is likewiſe repeated <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>And this of which we are now ſpeaking, and which has hapned in theſe our days, is a very famous, memorable, and well nigh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing; not done or accompliſhed without the particular providence and diſpoſition of the Almighty. A Frier has kill'd a King, not a painted one in paper, nor pictur'd out upon a wall; but the <hi>French</hi> King in the middle of his Armies, encompaſſed round about with his Guard and Souldiers: which truly is ſuch an Act, and done in ſuch a manner, that none will believe when it ſhall be told them, and perhaps our Poſterity after us will account and eſteem it but a Fable.</p>
               <p>That the King is dead, or elſe ſlain, it is eaſily to be believ'd; but that he is kill'd, and taken away in ſuch ſort, is hardly credible: Even as we preſently aſſent that Chriſt is born of a Woman; but if we further add, of a Virgin Woman, then according to Humane
<pb facs="tcp:96410:26"/>Reaſon we cannot aſſent unto it. And ſo we can readily believe that Chriſt died, but that he roſe from the dead to life again, this to mans natural underſtanding is impoſſible, and therefore incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, becauſe there is no return from a Privation to an Habit. That one is awakened again out of a Sleep, Ecſtaſie, or a Swoun, becauſe it is not againſt Nature we naturally believe it; but to be riſen again from the dead, it ſeemed ſo incredible a thing to Nature, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> diſputing with the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers about this very point, was diſguſted for it, and accuſed to be a Setter forth of new or ſtrange Gods; and ſome (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> reports) mocked him, others ſaid, <hi>We will hear thee again of this matter.</hi> Of ſuch things therefore which befall not according to the Laws of Nature, and the ordinary courſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſpeaketh the Prophet, <hi>viz. That none ſhall believe it when it ſhall be told them.</hi> But we give credit unto it whileſt we conſider the Omnipotency of God, and by ſubmitting our own Underſtandings to the Obedience of Faith, and the Commands of our Saviour Chriſt; and by theſe means what was incredible before by Nature, becometh credible by Faith: We therefore that as mere Men cannot believe Chriſt to be born of a Virgin, when this is further added, that it was wrought ſupernaturally by the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt, then we truly aſſent to it, and faithfully believe it. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when it is ſaid that Chriſt is riſen again from the dead, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we believe it not; but when it is affirmed that this was done by the Power of the Divine Nature, (which was in him) then we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and without any kind of doubting believe it.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, though to Natural Reaſon and Humane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity it may ſeem a thing incredible, or altogether improbable, that ſuch a mighty King ſhould be ſlain in the midſt of his Army, environ'd round with his Guards and Souldiers, by a poor, ſimple, weak, Religioniſt or Frier. Yet conſidering on the other ſide, the great and grievous ſins of this King, and the ſpecial Providence of the Almighty herein, and by what a ſtrange and wonderful way he hath accompliſhed his moſt juſt Will and Judgment againſt him, then we fully and moſt firmly believe it; and therefore this great and miraculous Work we are to aſcribe to a particular Providence of God onely; not as thoſe that erroneouſly refer all things unto ſome ordinary Cauſes, or unto Fortune, or ſuch like accidentary Events, but as thoſe who (more nearly obſerving and looking into the courſe
<pb facs="tcp:96410:27"/>of the whole matter) do eaſily ſee that there were many things in tervening in it, which could not have been brought to paſs, and diſpatched, without the ſpecial help of God. And truly the ſtate of Kings and Kingdoms, and all other ſuch rare and weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſhould not be thought to be Governed of God raſhly, and unadviſedly; there are ſome Inſtances in holy Writ of this nature, and none of them can be referred unto any other cauſe, but God only: but yet there is none wherein the celeſtial operation more appeareth, than in this, whereof we are now ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>We read in the firſt Book of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> c. 6. how <hi>Eleazer</hi> run himſelf upon a certain Death, to Kill the King that was an Enemy and Perſecutor of the People and Children of God: For, in the Battel, eſpying an Elephant higher and more ſtately than the reſt, whereon it was like the King rode, with a ſwift pace caſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the midſt of his Enemies Troops, here and there mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his way by force, he came to the Beaſt at laſt, and went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her and thruſt his Sword into her Belly, and ſlew her, who falling, with great weight of her Body preſs'd him to death, and Kill'd him out of hand. Here in this Inſtance we may ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not unlike to ours, <hi>viz.</hi> as to zeal, valiantneſs of mind, and the iſſue of the Enterprize; but in the reſt there is no Compariſon to be made. <hi>Eleazar</hi> was a Souldier exerciſed in Weapons, and trained up in Wars, ſet in Battel, emboldned with courage, and inflamed with rage and anger: This a Fryer, not inured to fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo abhoring blood by the Order of his Profeſſion, that perhaps he could not abide the cutting of a Vein.</p>
               <p>He knew the kind of his Death, as alſo the place of his Burial; namely, that he ſhould be Entombed under the fall of the Beaſt, and ſo buried in the midſt of his triumph and victory. This Man lookt for a certain death, and expected nothing but unknown and moſt cruel torments, and did not doubt before, but that he ſhould want a Grave to reſt within. But there be many other things wherein theſe two Inſtances can ſuffer no compariſon. The famous Hiſtory of the holy Woman <hi>Judith,</hi> is ſufficiently known, who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with her ſelf (God no doubt immediately moving her to it) that the might deliver the City and the People of God, to Kill <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:96410:27"/>appear many and moſt manifeſt ſigns of Heavenly Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet far greater Arguments of God's Providence are to be ſeen in killing of this King, and the delivering of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> far more difficult, and harder to be brought to paſs, than was the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of <hi>Judith.</hi> For this holy Woman diſcovered her intention to ſome of the Governours of the City, and paſſed through in ſight and preſence of the Elders and Princes of that place; and by that means was not ſubject unto their examination and ſearching, (which is always us'd ſo ſtrictly in time of Siege and War, that a Fly can hardly without examination eſcape them.) She being come to the Enemy, through whoſe Company and Watches ſhe was to go, and oftentimes ſearched and examined, being a Woman, and carrying no Letters nor Weapons about her, from whence any Suſpicion might ariſe, and withall yielding Reaſons for her coming thither, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning her Relations, was eaſily diſcharged; and not onely upon the forementioned cauſes, but alſo for her Sex and exquiſite Beauty, being brought before this lewd and unchaſt Prince, ſhe might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which ſhe had determined before. This is <hi>Judith</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>But this Religious Man undertook and perform'd a matter of greater weight, encompaſſed with ſo many Impediments, Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Dangers, that no Subtilty of Man, no humane policy, nor any worldly wiſdom, but onely the clear and viſible Providence of God, and his ſpecial Aid could bring it to paſs. Firſt, Letters Commendatory were to be procured of the contrary party, then was he conſtrained to go through that Gate of the City that led to the Enemy's Camp; the which without doubt was ſo narrowly kept and watched in the Extremity of that Siege, that every trifle bred ſuſpicion, and none were ſuffered to go forth without narrow ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before touching their Letters, Meſſages, Buſineſs, and Affairs they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad. But he (a wonderful thing) paſſed through the Watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined, yea with Letters Credential unto the Enemy; which if they had been intercepted by the Citizens, without any delay and further tryal he ſhould have been executed preſently. And therefore this is a manifeſt Argument of Gods Providence. But this is a far greater Miracle, that he without ſearching went alſo through the Enemies Camp, by divers Watches and Centinels, and (which is more) through the King's Guard <hi>du Corps;</hi> and finally, through the whole Army, which was made up moſtly of Hereticks, he being a

Judith</hi> was a Woman, and nothing odious, yet examined often; ſhe carried nothing that might have turned to her danger and deſtruction. This man a Frier, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hated, and moſt ſuſpected, having alſo a Knife prepared for that purpoſe, not in a Scabbard, (which might have made his Excuſe probable) but naked and concealed in his Sleeve; which if it had been found about him, he would queſtionleſs have been put to death Immediately. All theſe are ſuch clear Arguments of the particular Providence of God, that they cannot be denied; neither could it otherwiſe be, but that God blinded the Eyes of the Enemy, that they could not ſee nor know him. For (as we have ſaid before) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome do abſurdly aſcribe this unto Fortune or Chance, yet none can refer the whole matter to no other cauſe, but the will and holy purpoſe of God. And indeed I could not believe this to have been done otherwiſe, unleſs I ſhould captive or ſubmit my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the Obedience of Chriſt, who determined by theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous means to deliver and ſet at liberty the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> which as we have heard was in great danger and extremity, and to puniſh the notorious ſins of that King, and to deprive him of this Life by ſuch an unhappy and infamous kind of Death; and we truly (not without great inward grief) have oft-times foretold, that as he was the laſt of his Name and Family, ſo was he like to have and make ſome ſtrange and ſhameful end of his Life.

This therefore which we with grief have ſpoken, concerns the King's Perſon onely, whoſe unhappy and unlucky End deprives him alſo of thoſe Honourable Offices and Reſpects, which this Holy Seat (the tender Mother of all
<pb facs="tcp:96410:28"/>Faithful, but eſpecially of Chriſtian Princes) is wont to pay to Emperours and Kings; which we moſt willingly would likewiſe have beſtowed on him, if the Holy Scriptures in this caſe had not altogether forbidden it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>a ſin unto death;</hi> I ſay not that any ſhould pray for it, which may be underſtood either of the Sin it ſelf, as if he ſhould ſay for that Sin, or for the remiſſion of that Sin, I will that none ſhould pray, becauſe it is not pardonable: Or elſe (which comes to the ſame ſence) for that Man who committeth ſuch a Sin unto death, I ſay not that any ſhould pray for. Of which Sin our Saviour himſelf has ſpoken in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaying, <hi>That he that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come;</hi> where he ſetteth down three ſorts or kinds of Sins, to wit, againſt the Father, againſt the Son, and againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and that the two firſt are leſs heinous and pardonable, but that the third is altogether unpardonable. All which difference proceedeth from the diſtinction of the Attributes, (as the Schools teach us out of the holy Scriptures;) which ſeverally are appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to every ſeveral Perſon of the holy Trinity. For although as the Eſſence of all the three Perſons is but one, ſo alſo is their Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, (as we have learned out of S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, when he ſays, <hi>Tho Father Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy Ghoſt Almighty;</hi>) yet by Attribution Power is aſcribed unto the Father, Wiſdom unto the Son, and Love unto the Holy Ghoſt; whereof every ſeveral, as they are termed Attributes, are ſo proper unto every ſeveral Perſon, that they cannot be attributed and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto any other. By the Contraries of which Attributes we come to diſcern the diſtinction and greatneſs of Sin; the Contrary to Power (which is attributed to the Father) is Weakneſs or Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore that which we do amiſs through Infirmity, or Weakneſs of Nature, is ſaid to be committed againſt the Father. The oppoſite unto Wiſdom is Ignorance, through which when any man ſinneth, he is ſaid to ſin againſt the Son; and therefore what we commit through natural Infirmity or Ignorance, is more eaſily forgiven us. The third Attribute, which is the Holy Ghoſt's, is Love, and hath for its Contrary Ingratitude, a Vice moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and odious, which cauſeth men not to acknowledge the Love of God, and his Benefits beſtowed upon them; but to forget, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:96410:29"/>yea and to hate them; and from hence at laſt it comes to paſs, that they prove obſtinate and impenitent. And thus to ſin againſt God is far more dangerous and dreadful, than if it were done either through Ignorance or Natural Infirmity, and therefore it is termed a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and becauſe ſuch Sins are ſeldom and hardly, and not without great abundance of Grace pardoned, in ſome ſort they are ſaid to be unpardonable. Whereas Final Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence onely is really and ſimply unpardonable. For whatſoever is done amiſs in this Life, although it be againſt the Holy Ghoſt, yet by Repentance it may be wip'd out, or done away before we die; but they that perſevere therein till Death, are excluded from all grace and mercy hereafter. And therefore for ſuch Sins or Sinners the Apoſtle hath forbidden to pray after their Deceaſe. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe we underſtand (not without great grief) that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid King departed this Life without repentance, or impenitent, to wit, in the Communion and Fellowſhip of Hereticks, (for all his Army was made up almoſt of none other but of ſuch men) and that by his laſt Will he commended and made over his Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Succeſſion of <hi>Navar,</hi> long ſince declared an Heretick and Excommunicated; as alſo in his Extremity, and now ready to yield up the Ghoſt, deſired of him, and ſuch as he was then ſtanding by him, that they would revenge his Death upon thoſe whom he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Cauſe thereof. For theſe and ſuch like manifeſt Tokens of his Impenitency, we have decreed not to ſolemnize his Death with Funerals; not that we preſume any thing by theſe concerning God's ſecret Judgment againſt him, or his Mercies towards him, who could according to his good pleaſure convert and turn his Heart, even when his Soul was leaving the Body, and deal merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with him: but this we have ſpoken, being thereunto moved by theſe external Signs and Tokens.</p>
               <p>God grant that all being admoniſhed and warned by this fearful Example of Heavenly Juſtice may repent and amend, and that it may further pleaſe him to continue and accompliſh that which he hath thus mercifully begun for us (as we firmly hope he will) to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>From this Speech I ſhall onely infer two things: Firſt, That it is the Intereſt of all Proteſtant Princes (if they love their Lives) to ſuppreſs Popery in their Dominions. Secondly, That it is more particularly the Intereſt of His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> utterly to extirpate the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion out of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> there being a moſt damnable Helliſh Plot againſt His Majeſty's Royal Perſon and Government and his Proteſtant Subjects, ſtill carried on by the Papiſts.</p>

            <head>Some of the moſt Remarkable Paſſages of Q. <hi>Maries</hi> Reign.</head>
            <p>HAving given you the moſt famous Inſtances of the execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles and Practices of Papiſts, that I have met with in Forein Hiſtory, and ſhewed you that theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices are derived from the Diabolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, I ſhall now conclude with ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the like nature that occur in the Reign of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> being the moſt conſiderable on Record in our own Chronicles.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Q. <hi>Mary</hi> heard of her Brother K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Death, and that he had by his Will (with the conſent of his Council) excluded her, and nominated the Lady <hi>Jane Grey</hi> to ſucceed him, (the ſaid Q. <hi>Mary</hi> having been before Baſtardiz'd by her Father K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.) ſhe rode 40 miles in one day, from <hi>Norfolk</hi> to her Caſtle of <hi>Framing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in Suffolk;</hi> where taking upon her the Name and Title of Queen, ſhe gave notice to the Proteſtant Nobility and Centry of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>That if they would aſſiſt her ingetting the Crown, ſhe would not any ways attempt the leaſt Alteration of the Religion eſtabliſhed by her Brother K. Edward</hi> VI. This Declaration cauſed many of the prime Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to repair to her, and ſhe having given them her Royal Word and her Faith for performance thereof, did likewiſe as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confirmation ſign certain Articles of Agreement to that effect. Whereupon the Proteſtants aſſiſted her, and ſhe preſently wrote Letters to the Council in which ſhe claimed the Crown, and required them to proclaim her Queen of <hi>England in London,</hi> which was done accordingly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96410:30"/>
            <p>But ſhe was no ſooner got into the Throne, than ſhe broke her Word and Faith given to theſe Proteſtants, and (which is very ſtrange and remarkable) did afterward proſecute them more ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than ſhe did any other Proteſtants in the Kingdom; though ſhe kept her Faith with all of them alike, as you will ſee by and by.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I ſhall give you a particular Inſtance of her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and Breach of Faith toward a Proteſtant, that hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerved her, and the ſtory is briefly thus. Sir <hi>James Hales,</hi> a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Common Pleas, who had been a great and eminent Stickler for her Succeſſion, having given a Charge at a Quarter Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Kent,</hi> upon the Statutes of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and <hi>Edward</hi> VI. in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Primacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was by her order committed to priſon; of which ill requital of his Services he grew ſo ſenſible, that through diſcontent and trouble of Mind he once endeavoured to ſtab himſelf; and though he was then prevented in his deſign, yet not long after he drowned himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now you ſhall ſee how ſhe proceeded by degrees againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On the third of <hi>August</hi> 1553 ſhe rode through <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and on the fourth and fifth began to turn out the Proteſtant Biſhops, and to put Papiſts in their places; and preſently after ſhe diſplaced all the reſt of the Beneficed Clergy throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that were either married or refuſed to turn Papiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the twenty ſeventh of the ſame Moneth the Service began to be ſung in <hi>Latin</hi> in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame Year the Pope's Authority was reſtored in <hi>England,</hi> and the Maſs commanded to be uſed in all Churches.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſame Year ſhe cauſed a Synod to aſſemble, which reſtored the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and ordained Maſs to be celebrated after the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faſhion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fourth of <hi>February</hi> Mr. <hi>John Rogers,</hi> the firſt Martyr of thoſe times, was burnt at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Preſently after her Coronation ſhe pretended to ſhew Mercy, by granting a general Pardon but it was ſo interlaced (as an Author ſaith) with Exceptions of Matters and Perſons, that very few recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved benefit by, but many were trepann'd by it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In <hi>October</hi> 1554 ſhe cauſed <hi>Ridley</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to be ſent from the <hi>Tower of London</hi> (where
<pb facs="tcp:96410:30"/>they were Priſoners) to <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon pretence that they were to diſpute with the Papiſts about the Real Preſence of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; but when they were brought thither, inſtead of being diſputed with they were both burnt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The next thing ſhe did, was to ſet up again the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in <hi>England;</hi> and to this purpoſe ſhe ſent for Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> who being arrived with the Pope's Authority as <hi>Legatus à la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> made a Speech to the Parliament, exhorting them to return to the Boſom of the Church, for he was come (as he ſaid) to reconcile the People to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in order to a Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he required them preſently to repeal all Laws that had been made in derogation of the Catholick Religion. When the Speech was ended, the Parliament begg'd Pardon for their former Errors, and told the Queen they would repeal all ſuch Laws; whereupon the Cardinal accordingly gave them Abſolution. And ſo was all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in one day ſubjected again to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Yoke by this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Queen.</p>
            <p n="9">9. On the twelveth of <hi>March</hi> 1555 ſhe reſtored all the Lands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belonging to Abbies and Monaſteries that had been inveſted in the Crown, and did leave them to be diſpoſed of as the Pope ſhould think fit.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It's thought that ſhe had once reſolved to put her Siſter <hi>Fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> to death, for divers of the Privy Council had ſigned a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to that purpoſe; yet when the Lieutenant of the Tower had received the ſaid Warrant, he went to the Queen, and ſollicited her for her Siſters Life, ſhe proteſted ſhe knew nothing of ſuch a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. However it's believed that ſhe would have conſented to her Siſters Death, had her own Life been continued a little longer.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In her fourth Year Monaſteries began to be rebuilt and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and no doubt ſhe had in a ſhort time cauſed all the Abbey Lands in <hi>England</hi> to be reſtored, had not Death prevented her deſign.</p>
            <p n="12">12. To ſumme up all; it is recorded, That in leſs than 4 Years of this Queens Reign 277 Proteſtants were put to death for their Religion, without any regard had to Age, Sex, or Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> 5 Biſhops, 21 Divines, 8 Gentlemen, 84 Artificers, 100 Husbandmen, Servants, and Labourers, 26 Wives, 20 Widows, 19 Virgins, 2 Boys, and 2 Infants; alſo near as many died in Priſons through Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and other Hardſhips. So that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith, that though
<pb facs="tcp:96410:31"/>many Perſecutions laſted longer than this, yet none ſince <hi>Diocleſians</hi> time raged ſo terribly.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="conclusion">
            <p>You have ſeen the horrid Actions committed by <hi>Charles</hi> IX. of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England;</hi> and yet Hiſtory tells us nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that he was not of a bloudy or cruel diſpoſition; and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that ſhe was of a mild and gentle temper: ſo that we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conclude, that the Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion do infallibly debauch both the Conſciences and Morals of all ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid I infer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants of the meaneſt capacities may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Prophecy) be able to foretell what will become of them, if (which God forbid) Popery ſhould again prevail, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh'd amongſt us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is no leſs the Intereſt than the Duty of all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, to pray for the long and proſperous Reign of our preſent Proteſtant Prince in whoſe Life (next under God) are bound up our Lives, Religion, Laws, Government, Liberties, and Properties.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That it is our Duty, for the good and welfare of Poſterity, to pray, That all His Majeſty's Succeſſors in the Government, may be Proteſtants to the end of the World. <hi>Amen.</hi>
